                <h2 class="study-card-h2">Problem</h2>
                <p class="study-content problem-text">Camtasia users can add quizzing to their videos, allowing them to conduct surveys and test their user's understanding of their videos. But this must be done before producing and sharing to the web. Users are unable to add, revise, or update quizzing to their media after it is uploaded to Screencast or Knowmia.</p>
                <p class="study-content problem-text">We did have some sort of solution for our corporate and education customers through Knowmia. But that solution was dated, built on depricated tech stacks and lacking parity to the desktop experience. So how could I take the existing experience and bring it up to standard and be available to users outside those walled garden environments?</p>

                <p class="study-content journey-text">I was fortunate to have a history with the product, the services, and the customer base. So I had a good understanding of where I wanted to take the project given everything I already knew. I knew I wanted to have a few basic things for sure.</p>
                <p class="study-content journey-text">1. It should be a Single Page App, a destination for doing work, that could be hosted in any of the web services that the company offers.</p>
                <p class="study-content journey-text">2. It should bridge the feature parity gap with the Camtasia desktop experience where possible, while also offering the flexibility the web provided.</p>
                <p class="study-content journey-text">3. Lastly, it should be built in a sustainable way, with usability and accessibility first.</p>

            <article class="study-container knowns-unknowns">
                <h2 class="study-card-h2">...& Unknowns</h2>
                <p class="study-content knowns-text">I already had a history with our users, but there were a lot of questions still. So, I did the best thing I could think of to make sure we built the right thing for our users. I asked them.</p>
                <p class="study-content knowns-text">The first thing I did was gather the analytics and data that we had available for current usage in our products and services. I found out how many Camtasia quiz reports were generated on average each day, and from that list was able to narrow down a few thousand email addresses of users who had opted into offering feedback on the service.</p>
                <p class="study-content knowns-text">This survey had an impressive response rate, and I had a ton of data to work with. So I made a short list of users who were excited to help shape the future of the product they relied on so much. I was able to tap these users for interviews, which provided more context and feedback on mockups and prototypes.</p>
                <p class="study-content knowns-text">These interviews might just be the best part of the job. Seeing and hearing from users first hand doesn't just provide context, it invigorates and inspires myself and the team. Hearing just how excited people are, or how a change to a workflow could save them time and effort, or fixing a nagging bug that we didn't know about could mean the differnce between a student being heard in a virtual classroom or not... it's meaningful and important.</p>

                <img src="/img/Bear-Profile.png" id="logo-header">
                <p class="study-content outcome-text">A lesson in passion and perserverence. Just because this project was deprioritized didn't mean I was giving up on it. I'm fortunate in my work to have "20% Time" - which let me continue advocating for, and working on this project on my own. And when you can show the impact a project like this has on users, it's not hard to rally peers to lend their 20% Time to help out.</p>
                <p class="study-content iterate-text">Like all web products, this is a work in progress and there is always room for improving. Given the constraints in time and resources, it's moving along slowly - but steady. And there is so much promise on the horizon.</p>
                <p class="study-content iterate-text">In today's virtual-first world, it is so important having these meaningful interactions that allow educators to be successful, and knowing that the work I've done could help a student succeed is an incredibly rewarding outcome.</p>
