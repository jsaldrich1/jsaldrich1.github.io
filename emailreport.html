                <h2 class="study-card-h2">Problem</h2>
                <p class="study-content problem-text">Sometimes work gets done, we stop working on it and it becomes stale and unsustainable. That was the case for an email report that TechSmith Quizzing users receive.
                <p class="study-content problem-text">When data is collected on a video quiz, the system sends an email report to the quiz owner. That email system was technically working, but I wanted to add a few requirements.</p>
                <h3 class="study-content problem-text">1. Images as Buttons</h3>
                <p class="study-content problem-text">These emails were created circa 2012-2013, there were several elements that could be modernized - such as replacing images that were used as buttons with HTML and CSS.</p>
                <h3 class="study-content problem-text">2. Responsive</h3>
                <p class="study-content problem-text">Devices have changed a lot since these emails were first developed. Viewing your reports on your phone was not a good time.</p>
                <h3 class="study-content problem-text">3. Accessibility</h3>
                <p class="study-content problem-text">These reports were only available in three languages, while we had customers speaking eight. There were also no support for screen readers.</p>

                <h2 class="study-card-h2">[Internal] Competitive Analysis</h2>
                <p class="study-content journey-text">I looked around at what other departments and products within the company were using to create, manage, and send email. There were a couple options, and every choice provided better scalability, reliability, and analytics. In the end, I chose the system that allowed non-technical team members (like marketing) to interact with the templates: Sparkpost.</p>
                <p class="study-content journey-text">The Design Manager for my team had been working on standardizing email designs across products and services, but hadn't yet implemented any of his ideas. It gave me a great head start on designing for my product and writing the HTML and CSS.</p>

                <h2 class="study-card-h2">Composing Email</h2>
                <p class="study-content composing-text">The web has come a long way, but email remains a complex mess of old practices and standards. But that doesn't mean that we can't make the best of the basics. HTML and CSS are powerful, and replacing all the "images as buttons" with proper code, with alt text and responsiveness makes a huge impact on every user.</p>

                <h2 class="study-card-h2">Outcome</h2>
                <p class="study-content outcome-text">When Quiz Reports are sent out, users get a more modern looking email. They also can view that email across different screen sizes and devices, they can access the data with their screen reader or keyboard. If their email client blocks images, they can still see the call to action and other buttons.</p>
                <p class="study-content iterate-text">This work also set the groundwork to implement the design systems for unified email across the company's products and services - including some others that I'm actively working through now.</p>
