                <p class="study-content problem-text"><a href="https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html" target="_blank">Camtasia</a> users can add quizzing to their videos, allowing them to conduct surveys and test their user's understanding of their videos. But this must be done before producing and sharing to the web. Users are unable to add, revise, or update quizzing on their media after it is uploaded.</p>
                <p class="study-content problem-text">I was on original team that implemented a web version for our corporate and education customers in <a href="https://www.techsmith.com/knowmia-education.html" target="_blank">Knowmia</a>. But it was built on a deprecated tech stacks and lacking parity to the desktop experience. So how could I take the existing experience and bring it up to standard and be available to users outside those walled garden environments?</p>

            <article class="study-container journey">
                <p class="study-content journey-text">I'm fortunate to have a history with the product, the services, and the customer base. So I had a good understanding of where to start the project given known issues and some customer feedback. I knew I wanted to have a few basic things for sure.</p>
                <h3 class="study-content">1. SPA</h3>
                <p class="study-content journey-text">It should be a Single Page App, a destination for doing work, that can be hosted in any of the web services that the company offers.</p>
                <h3 class="study-content">2. Feature Parity</h3>
                <p class="study-content journey-text">It should bridge the feature parity gap with the Camtasia desktop experience where possible, while also offering the flexibility the web provided.</p>
                <h3 class="study-content">3. Flexible & Accessible</h3>
                <p class="study-content journey-text">Lastly, it should be built in a sustainable way, with usability and accessibility first.</p>

            <article class="study-container knowns-unknowns">
                <h3 class="study-content">Existing Analytics</h3>
                <p class="study-content knowns-text">There were a lot of questions still. So, to make sure we built the right thing for our users: I asked them what they needed.</p>
                <p class="study-content knowns-text">The first thing I did was gather the analytics and data that we had available for current usage in our products and services. I found out how many Camtasia quiz reports were generated on average each day, and from that list was able to narrow down a few thousand email addresses of users who had opted into offering feedback on the service. </p>
                <h3 class="study-content">Email Campaign</h3>
                <p class="study-content knowns-text">With this list at the ready, I composed a survey and reached out to about 3000 users. This survey had an impressive response rate, and I had a ton of data to work with. So after parsing the data, I made a short list of users who were excited to help shape the future of the product they relied on so much.</p>
                <h3 class="study-content">User Interviews</h3>
                <p class="study-content knowns-text">With a group of excited educators and instructors happy to jump on a Zoom call, it was easy and invigorating to tap these users for interviews. I conducted a number of user interviews where I was able to walk users through my ideas for workflows and prototypes of new designs. These interviews provide some of the best feedback for making difficult decisions, and I believe they are essential to making a product that will actually serve its userbase.</p>

            <article class="study-container iterate">
                <p class="study-content outcome-text">A lesson in passion and perseverance. Just because this project was de-prioritized didn't mean I was giving up on it. I'm fortunate in my work to have "20% Time" - which let me continue advocating for, and working on this project on my own. And when you can show the impact a project like this has on users, it's not hard to rally peers to lend their 20% Time to help out.</p>
                <p class="study-content iterate-text">Like all web products, this is a work in progress and there is always room for improving. Given the constraints in time and resources, it's moving along slowly - but steady. And there is so much promise on the horizon.</p>

            <img src="/img/SecondQuizFade.gif" class="full-width-image">

            <article class="study-container outcome">
                <p class="study-content outcome-text">A web application that pushed the boundaries of interactive video content. This application allows users to bring content produced within Camtasia, or create entirely on the web - without compromising functionality.</p>
                <p class="study-content outcome-text">In today's virtual-first world, it is  more important than ever having these meaningful interactions, allowing educators to be successful. And knowing that the work I've done could help a student succeed is an unbeatable reward.</p>
