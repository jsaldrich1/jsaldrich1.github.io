# Portfolio
This is another Internet Portfolio. Behold it's marvel.

# Shout out to [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/)
This portfolio layout is based on the free template, [Freelancer](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/), provided by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/).  I humbly snagged it off the Internet for a number of reasons, least of which is that it just, plain, works.

Thanks!
